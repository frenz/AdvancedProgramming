    Assignment 3

    Posted on: Tuesday, October 14, 2014 9:02:42 PM CEST

    Hi all,

    For those of you who have already submitted assignment 3, please resubmit, testing is now enabled

    A small hint concerning the Iterator: it is a built in java interface, no need to create an iterator class. You can get an Iterator from an ArrayList by using arrayList.iterator();

    Iterator

    Posted on: Saturday, October 11, 2014 1:02:29 PM CEST

    Hi all,

    The most widely used version of java is java7, documentation for the arraylist can be found at: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/

    For assignment 3: the manual states you should have a Iterator ascending/descendingIterator, this should be Iterator<E> ascending/descendingIterator

    Reminder deadline practical

    Posted on: Wednesday, October 8, 2014 7:31:00 AM CEST

    Hello everyone,

    Hereby we want to remind you that the deadline of the practical is 23:59 Friday 17/10/2014. To get a sufficient grade for the course all three assignments need to be approved by your assistant and need to be handed in before the deadline. The average of the three exercises should be equal or greater than 5,5.

    Automated testing

    Posted on: Tuesday, September 23, 2014 12:25:20 AM CEST

    Hi all,

    A succesful test during upload looks like this:

    Compilation complete
    Testing... Done
    Sending email to TA... Done

    If your program does not reach the Done while testing, it is most probably hanging on an empty line, flooding the testscript with errors until it aborts to protect the server.

    You can fix this easily by creating a second scanner, which will only contain the line you are currently processing. Create your processLine method (example) like this:

    processLine(Scanner inBefore, Set s){
      Scanner in = new Scanner(inBefore.nextLine());
      //Perform magic
    }

    By doing this, you are making sure the complete line is gone from the inBefore scanner. I will try to incorporate this in the test program. If you are not sure if this is the case for your latest submission, just resubmit and wait for the submission page to completely load. Disregard the message of a succesful upload, that just implies your file is stored on our system.

    Best of luck

    Assignment 1

    Posted on: Thursday, September 18, 2014 12:31:20 PM CEST

    Hi all,

    Please let your program print an empty line after the user presses ctrl-D (or ctrl-Z). You can do this by appending your main method to look like this:

    public static void main(String[] argv){ //No changes  new Program().start(); //No changes
      System.out.println(); //new
    }

    Otherwise, the automated test might not register the final line of your output. This is a restriction in the way java runs processes, I am looking for a more permanent solution

    Secondly, please note that the automated test puts all input onto the System.in at once, so do not create more than 1 scanner to System.in

    Finally, please start uploading your files on practool for testing, so your TA can get you your feedback. These submission are not relevant to your grade. Only after passing all tests will a program be accepted!

    Best of luck

    Hi all,

    You can now submit assignment 1 on PracTool (phoenix.labs.vu.nl).

    1. Register an account if you do not already have one.
    2. Select Advanced Programming, then select your TA. Selecting the wrong TA will send the testreports to the wrong TA, so be careful with selection. I something goes wrong, please drop me an email at r.f.bethlehem@vu.nl
    3. Select 'click here to upload assignment'
    4. Select your file, and submit.

    PracTool will take you to the upload page, testing your submission, and storing it in the database. If you receive an error about invalid files, recheck the file you uploaded for the offending file. For other errors, emailme

    Best of luck,
    Ronald

    JavaDoc

    Posted on: Thursday, September 11, 2014 2:28:49 PM CEST

    Hi all,

    The correct extra settings for javadoc in eclipse should be:

    nodeprecated
    nodeprecatedlist
    quiet
    author
    -tag elements:a:"Elements"
    -tag structure:a:"Structure"
    -tag domain:a:"Domain"
    -tag constructor:a:"Constructor"
    -tag param
    -tag precondition:a:"PRE-condition"
    -tag postcondition:a:"POST-condition"
    -tag throw

    The manual did not mention the hypen before 'tag' (Credits to Bjarty Garcia for pointing this out), and is partially in Dutch

    Also, the javadoc.exe can be found in the jdk/bin/ folder. Check your java folder in C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)

    EDIT: structure, not structuer

    Group enrollment

    Posted on: Thursday, September 4, 2014 9:27:35 PM CEST

    Dear students,

    Tomorrow at 11:00 o'clock in the morning the group enrollment will be opened. Each group has two meetings a week. A group consists of two persons (no more, no less). Please look carefully at the day, times and weeks of the meetings before you decide which group you join. If you haven't found a partner yet, no worries. Just enroll yourself in a group and we will find a partner for you (we merge all the one person groups this weekend). 

    If you have any questions or experience any trouble regarding the group enrollment, feel free to contact me: Bram Rodenburg, b.p.m.rodenburg@vu.nl.

    Kind regards
